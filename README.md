## TASK LIST

- [ ] Fix audio player page overflow since reformat
- [ ] Heading font elements acting as buttons should be gold with a blue outline and some gaussian blur oval behind it like in the game's UI, like the detail buttons or the download button in audio player page
- [ ] Rowspan table should have the first cell highlighted if I'm highlighting any relevant cell (IE any seal position should highlight the first cell that shows the paired region)
