# Project Planning & Methodology

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Reverse engineer Myth War (2003-2006 era) proprietary game engine, including RAYSSDK media containers and launcher effects, to understand implementation and recreate using modern technologies.

**Note**: Water ripple effect is launcher menu feature only - broader engine analysis is primary focus.

**Scope**: Complete analysis from executable extraction to modern implementation
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks depending on game complexity
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Prerequisites

### Required Skills

- Basic understanding of graphics programming
- Familiarity with shader languages (HLSL, GLSL, or similar)
- Knowledge of DirectDraw ~7, DirectX 8/9 or OpenGL 1.x-2.x era graphics APIs
- Experience with reverse engineering tools
- Understanding of linear algebra and wave mathematics

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows machine (for DirectX analysis)
- Sufficient storage for game files and extracted resources
- GPU capable of running modern shaders (for testing recreations)

## Tools and Software

### Essential Tools

- **Reverse Engineering**: IDA Pro, GhIDA, Binary Ninja, or x64dbg
- **Resource Extraction**: Resource Hacker, PE Explorer, or Innounp
- **Hex Editors**: HxD, Hex Workshop, or Bless
- **Graphics Analysis**: RenderDoc, NVIDIA Nsight, or AMD GPU PerfStudio
- **Shader Tools**: HLSL compiler, GLSL validator, shader editors
- **Development**: Visual Studio, shader compilers, graphics debugging tools

### Optional/Advanced Tools

- **Decompilers**: .NET Reflector (if .NET), Java decompilers (if applicable)
- **Memory Analysis**: Cheat Engine, WinDbg
- **Graphics Debugging**: PIX for Windows, GPU-specific tools
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking progress and implementations

## Phase-Based Approach

### Phase 1: Identification and Setup ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Game identification and version analysis
- [x] Executable architecture assessment
- [x] **Water ripple effect analysis** [water_ripple_analysis.md](water_ripple_analysis.md)
- [x] Initial tool setup and environment preparation

### Phase 2: Documentation Analysis & Executable Analysis (CURRENT)

- [ ] RAYSSDK documentation extraction and analysis
- [ ] Technical documentation review [technical_documentation_analysis.md](technical_documentation_analysis.md)
- [ ] Corporate history analysis [corporate_history_analysis.md](corporate_history_analysis.md)
- [ ] Executable static analysis
- [ ] Resource extraction and cataloging

### Phase 3: Graphics Pipeline Research

- [ ] DirectX 8/9 shader model research
- [ ] Vertex and pixel shader capability analysis
- [ ] Fixed function vs programmable pipeline documentation
- [ ] Graphics API function mapping

### Phase 4: Algorithm Understanding

- [ ] 2D wave equation implementation analysis
- [ ] Ripple propagation algorithm documentation
- [ ] Damping and attenuation method analysis
- [ ] Mathematical model documentation

### Phase 5: Modern Recreation

- [ ] Target shader language selection (HLSL/GLSL)
- [ ] Vertex shader equivalent implementation
- [ ] Pixel shader functionality recreation
- [ ] Modern enhancement integration

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Visual result comparison with original
- [ ] Hardware configuration testing
- [ ] Mathematical accuracy validation
- [ ] GPU optimization implementation

### Phase 7: Documentation

- [ ] Comprehensive technical documentation
- [ ] Implementation difference analysis
- [ ] Usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Comparison documentation with visuals

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Medium**: Complex proprietary RAYSSDK formats (MITIGATED by SDK documentation discovery)
- **Low**: Documentation gaps (SDK docs found - major mitigation)
- **Medium**: Undocumented proprietary graphics API usage
- **Low**: Standard wave mathematics (launcher effect only)

### Time Risks

- **High**: Extensive debugging required
- **Medium**: Resource extraction complexity
- **Low**: Algorithm understanding

### Success Metrics

- [x] Successfully extract original shaders ✅ (CONFIRMED: CPU-based, not shaders)
- [x] Understand wave propagation algorithm ✅ (CONFIRMED: 0.5-0.6ms DirectDraw surface manipulation)
- [ ] Recreate effect with 90%+ visual accuracy
- [ ] Implement in modern shader language
- [ ] Document complete process
