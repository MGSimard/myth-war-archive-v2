            <p>The war among the Gods had become a pivotal episode in history, leaving the living world in chaos.</p>
            <p>
              The mystical dimension created by the Great One granted the Gods infinite power. Nevertheless, the Gods
              were still severely restricted by the laws of balance, and none of them could escape the final stages of
              life. Driven by their desire to bring about an ending, they broke the promises they had made to the
              Dominator, abandoned the rules they themselves had established, and eventually waged a war that shattered
              every limitation between them. This insulted the pride and honor of the Great One. The chaos engulfing
              this once-balanced world was an ironic joke to the Gods, for it was they who had crafted those rules for
              their own benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this epic age lived Arthunzala, a human prince plagued by recurring dreams of the moment when his
              parents were murdered before his eyes while he was still a child. Yet he became a wandering prince, a
              brave warrior, and ultimately a king who bore great responsibility. The hardships of his youth nurtured
              his kindness and refined his character; his trying experiences made him all the more noble.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early days of the surreal dimension, an unforgettable war of rank erupted. It ignited fury among
              the Gods, causing them to neglect the dimensional laws laid down by the Dominator. At first, the surreal
              dimension was empty and extremely chaotic—spirits and evil creatures wandered aimlessly. As time passed,
              they realized the potential of united strength and joined forces. Their desire for independence spurred
              their maturity, and thus the Great One came into being. Having lost his way in the chaotic world, he
              resolved to reconstruct it according to his own ideals. In his dream he envisioned a brand-new dimension—a
              peaceful realm, a kingdom of order. The world he created consisted of three layers: the outermost
              dimension, the middle dimension, and the innermost dimension.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the Great One grew weary of thinking and dreaming, he split his body and spirit to spawn six main
              gods: the God of Power, the God of Justice, the God of Fire, the God of Evil, the God of Intelligence, and
              the God of Darkness. With the former ruler&apos;s reign ended, these gods inherited his spirit and took
              charge of the systems and resources of the new dimension. The laws of this world limited each god&apos;s
              power to preserve balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gods created another beautiful and peaceful land for their people. It stood independently in the upper
              dimension between the World of Gods and the balanced living world. Thus the four dimensions were isolated
              from one another. The only way to travel between them was through high-tech shuttle machines that linked
              all four realms. Crystal-blue skies, magnificent waterfalls, a supernatural double moon, vast plains,
              mystical ancient forests, swamps shrouded in toxic black gas, uninhabited deserts, and polar regions of
              extreme temperature—all these features co-existed in harmony and fascinated every onlooker. Here the Great
              One placed two kinds of intelligent beings—humans and centaurs. Neutral and independent, they were free
              from the control of any god and developed unique civilizations of their own. Deep within the innermost
              dimension lay the place of reincarnation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The presence of devils, monsters, and fiendish creatures made this dimension evil and frightening. Black
              soil, burning lava, and bizarre weather shrouded the land in chaos. The God of Hell, ruling this distant
              realm far from the World of Gods, enjoyed greater freedom to wield his power and therefore created five
              magical beasts. To living creatures, their world seemed complicated yet orderly. However, the ostensibly
              peaceful World of Gods was rife with crisis. The God of Evil, born of the Great One&apos;s darker will,
              could not endure the restraints of balanced power distribution and resolved to challenge the
              highest-ranking gods. Believing that selfishness was sometimes necessary for an independent evil will, he
              sought an alliance with the God of Hell. Unaware that desire, once awakened, cannot be controlled, the God
              of Hell accepted his proposal, yet soon broke their pact of mutual benefit. He and his magical beasts were
              the first to launch the Ranking War.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entire dimension trembled during this strange war. Living creatures sensed impending natural
              disasters—tsunamis, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes. They prayed, confessed, and implored the Gods,
              "What have we done wrong?" Their pleas went unanswered; all they received were endless catastrophes and
              death. The God of Hell underestimated the combined might of the other gods. After many defeats he
              retreated deep into the inner dimension and hid within the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life, planted by the
              Great One, was a wondrous entity: the whole dimension, its resources, and even the powers the Gods
              possessed all stemmed from it. It was also the only place beyond the rule of the six Gods. The Tree of
              Life would not shelter rebels, so the God of Hell faced the cruellest punishment—tortured both physically
              and spiritually, bound endlessly by chains of ice and fire. Meanwhile, the five beasts were sealed apart
              from one another within five Spiritual Stones, waiting for time itself to erode their bonds. No one
              suspected that these stones, each bearing a special duty, concealed an even greater power.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gods&apos; power sprang from the soul, and desire rendered the Evil God silent no longer. He coveted
              the Spiritual Stones. While attempting to unseal them before the holy altar, the Guarding Prime Gods
              discovered him. Another terrible war followed—a conflict of blood and fire, of evil versus justice. The
              Evil God was defeated and lay in a pool of his own blood. As his blood seeped into the Spiritual Stones,
              he uttered a sinister curse with his final breath. None had imagined that divine blood was the key to
              releasing the Stones&apos; power, nor that the Stones could grant wishes in exchange for life. The curse
              proved true. As the Gods died one by one and became spirits, the Sky Passage crashed into the middle
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The violent impact drove the civilizations of the middle world backward, pushing the balanced living world
              to the brink of destruction and distorting the dimensions. Having become disembodied spirits, the Gods
              wandered the outer dimension with only the slightest power to sustain their existence. Everything had
              returned to the beginning. To avoid fading away, they strove to win the faith and will of creatures in the
              middle dimension. Even so, the Gods maintained their noble demeanor. They helped the races of the middle
              realm develop technology, establish laws, and even learn to cast spells. In return, each race was required
              to build a sanctuary to honour the Gods and gather more believers. What the Gods needed most was an army
              of devotees. In every dimension, nothing could escape the universal law of returning. Yet the
              Gods—clinging to circular logic and driven by the desire to survive—ignited the greatest conflict of all:
              the War of Gods. Maddened, they no longer acknowledged the rules of the dimensions. Vengeance led to their
              annihilation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wars, cruelty, murder, contests, desire, and magic—all these define this dimension and fill its history
              with surprises, adventures, and romance.

            <h3>Humans</h3>
            <p>
              Humans are a fallen tribe and they are the weakest amongst all the races. The lives of humans are not
              affluent and stable so in order to survive, they have no choice but to do whatever they can even if it
              means doing something immoral or illegal. Smart, reckless, wicked and go-getting are the best words to
              describe the human character class in this game.
            </p>
            <h4>Paladin</h4>
            <p>
              Paladins are great warriors who have a heart to save the weak. Their main purpose in life is to pursue
              Godliness. They spend their lives training themselves up in order to protect their lands and as a result,
              they have advanced combating skills and possess greater stamina and power than other classes. They are
              mainly noted for their superior crime and combat skills. Apart from the offensive side of Paladin nature,
              they are also good at defense. One can term them as moving castles during battles. However one drawback of
              this class is that the equipment they carry is relatively heavy because of all the heavy-based weapons and
              armor they carry and therefore their agility is compromised. A high level paladin is able to advance to a
              magic-swordsman.
            </p>
            <h4>Thief</h4>
            <p>
              Thieves are known to have a wicked and nasty nature. Their outward appearance takes on the usual shape of
              a slim body and they dress in a corset and mask mainly. Their main choice of weapons are daggers and
              knives. Their agility level is the highest amongst all classes. Obviously, they are experts in stealing
              money and items from their enemies as that is what they do. They gain fame and recognition from this
              activity. Their fast attacking speeds show no mercy to their enemies and if necessary they are able to
              evade attacks as well. Thieves can be powerful allies to team up with. A high leveled thief can be
              advanced to become an assassinator.

            <h3>Centaurs</h3>
            <p>
              Like humans, centaurs have a long history and civilization. In contrast with other races, centaurs have a
              social system whereby the female possesses a higher status than a male in the common population. They are
              prized to be noble and beautiful. Centaurs live atop the World Tree. Since they rely on the life water
              from the World Tree, they are able to live on over hundreds or even a thousand years. They love peace and
              like to live in a quiet environment. When Centaurs choose to apply forces, it is mainly because they are
              protecting their own land or preserving their set of rules. There is no battle in the world relevant to
              justice that Centaurs do not show up. They are born with great agility and have a higher intelligence
              level compared to humans. Greater knowledge and more magic skills make centaurs a formidable entity.
            </p>
            <h4>Archer</h4>
            <p>
              Strength, agility and intelligence are never enough to archers who spend their lives to pursue peace and
              justice. They adopt range weapons, and are masters in using bows and crossbows. They are born with
              fantastic foresight that give them a great tactical advantage even before battles start. Normally, they
              dress lightly with light armors or silky clothes to make sure their agilities will not be affected; One
              disadvantage of this is that their armor shielding is low and they have low hit points as well. A
              high-leveled archer is up gradable to become a hunter.
            </p>
            <h4>Elf</h4>
            <p>
              Elves have a lot of respect for nature and are often one with nature. This enables them to tune in to
              their natural healing and blessing skills. Elves are very important team platers as they move fast and
              attack fast as well as have high chances to evade attacks. Elves have great advantages when facing enemies
              like the undead because they are able to bless teammates with the force of nature. Elves however are very
              delicate and there is a strong need to protect them in battle. High leveled elves are up gradable to
              become Knight-elves.

            <h3>Mages</h3>
            <p>
              Mages are a combination of the human and centaur class. Their race was cursed ever since it existed and
              was cursed again after they sold their souls to the dark lord. Their skin is a weird tinge of blue due to
              a curse by the Gods. This prevents them from ever seeing or being in sunlight. The lands they inhabit are
              filled with nothing but darkness. This unfairness they felt lead to great hatred and a strong desire to
              take revenge. However they were clever to forgive to the world and progress in a more positive direction.
              By using their intelligence, they established the largest economic center in the planet and gained trust
              by helping strong races to develop and prosper.
            </p>
            <h4>Priest</h4>
            <p>
              Priests are capable of casting incredibly powerful spells by utilizing the powers of wind, thunder, water
              and fire. Their brand of magic is dark in opposition to the holy one. As they are deprived of sunlight,
              they are weak at closed battle. They compensate for this weakness by having spells which can have
              unbelievable powers, having great advantages over their enemies during melee attacks. However, their
              weakest links are their low armor and low hit points. A priest is able to advance to High Priest.
            </p>
            <h4>Witch</h4>
            <p>
              Witches have the power to combine ancient charms to exert influences over substances and matter. They hold
              the power to announce death and use this power in battle. They have similar attack features as priest such
              as low hit points, but they have a comparatively higher attack damage. A witch can be advanced to become a
              high-witch.

            <h3>Borgs</h3>
            <p>
              Half human robots were developed by humans during the decades of miracles. After the ranking wars, the
              release of the power from the magical stones caused most of the infrastructure to be destroyed. Leaving
              the robots no power to maintain themselves. Most of them were shutdown having a long winter sleep under
              ground. Some of them decayed and disappeared along the way and some managed to preserve themselves. When
              the Myth War arrived, mages stumbled across them and it ignited the mages interests, since mages had been
              trying to develop something that could overcome their physical shortcomings. "Silver Driver" - an
              embodiment of the mages advanced intelligence was put in the robots body to make them move again. Parts of
              this robot would release rays of light as the Silver Driver was operating. Moreover, inspired by
              technology the mages invented a flight propulsion system for the robots which enabled them to fly without
              using magic.
            </p>
            <h4>Tyrant</h4>
            <p>
              Tyrants emerge from the ruins so they are more adept to battle, having a super-powerful body. They are
              great experts in battle and have only one focus on their mind, to attack. Although they can only use slow
              and heavy weapons the damage inflicted is massive. They are good at absorbing hit points as well as
              rebounding attacks.
            </p>
            <h4>Cyborg</h4>
            <p>
              Cyborgs are designed to protect and prolong lives. They have resistance to all spells being machine based
              and they have a longer life span than their biological enemies. They excel in team battles due to their
              healing contribution. They are also good at solo fights. Their primary weapons are spears. As a spear is a
              double armed weapon, they cannot use shields. They have lower attacking rates, weak defense but can absorb
              a lot of damage.
