            <p>The war among the Gods had become a pivotal episode in history and left the living world in chaos.</p>
            <p>
              The mystical dimension created by the Great One had granted the Gods infinite powers. Be that as it may,
              Gods were still restricted severely by the rules of balance of the mystic dimension, and none of them
              could escape the final stages of life. Fueled by their desires to create an ending, they ignored the
              promises they made to the Dominator, abandoning rules which they established, and eventually created a war
              among Gods which broke all restrictions between themselves. This was insulting to the pride and honor of
              the Great One; The chaos taking place in this balanced living world, was an ironic joke to the Gods
              themselves, since they themselves established all those rules for their own good.

              In this epic period of history lived Arthunzala. Arthunzala was a human prince who had dreams which scenes
              kept repeating on and on forever. His dreams were of the moment when his parents were murdered right in
              front of him, while he was still a child. Nevertheless he was a wandering prince, a brave warrior, and
              ultimately the king who bears great responsibility. The hardship of growing up cultivated his kindness and
              refined his character; His frustrating experiences made him more noble.

              At the ancient time of the surreal dimension, there was an unforgettable war of the ranks. It ignited fury
              between one and another, causing the Gods to ignore the dimension rules stated by the Dominator. At the
              very early stage, the surreal dimension was empty and extremely chaotic. Spirits and evil creatures
              wandered around. As time flew by, realized the potential of combined power and they joined forces. The
              need to be independent made them mature in time, and the Great One was spawned. The Great One lost his way
              in the chaos world, so he decided to reconstruct the world according to his own ideologies. In his dream,
              he dreamt of a brand new dimension, a peaceful world, a kingdom with order. The world created by the Great
              One consisted of three dimensions: the outermost dimension; the middle dimension; and the innermost
              dimension.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Great One was tired of thinking and dreaming, he let his body as well as his spirits split up to
              spawn six main gods: the God of Power, the God of Justice, the God of Fire, the God of Evil, the God of
              Intelligence, and the God of Darkness. As the previous ruler's reign had ended, these gods inherited his
              spirit and would rule the system and resources of the new dimension. The rules of the new dimension
              restricted the different gods' powers to ensure balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gods had created another beautiful and peaceful land for their people. It was built independently in the
              upper dimension in-between the World of Gods and the Balanced living world. Hence four dimensions were
              blocked out from one to another. The only way to travel through them was to use the high-tech shuttle
              machines which connected all four dimensions. The crystal-blue skies, the beautiful waterfalls, the
              supernatural double moon, the wide plains, the mystical ancient forests, swamps covered by black toxic
              gas, the inhabited desert, the polar region with extreme temperatures. All these were features of the
              world which existed in harmony and fascinated everyone. This was where Great One put in two sorts of
              intelligent creatures—mankind and centaurs. They were neutral and independent, free from the controls of
              any gods, and had created their unique civilizations. In the innermost dimension, lay the place of
              reincarnation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The presence of devils, monsters and fiendish creatures made this dimension evil and frightening. The
              black soil, the burning lava and the weird weather covered this place with chaos and evil. The God of
              Hell, as the one who ruled this place is far away from the World of Gods, had more freedom to use his
              power. As a result, he had created five magical beasts. In the eyes of the living creatures, their world
              seems to be complicated but yet in order. However, the World of Gods as peaceful as one may think it
              should be is full of crisis. The God of evil who was spawned by the Great One's evil wills, could not bear
              the restrictions of the balanced power distribution, he was willing to challenge the highest-ranking
              gods... But he knew, to a God, selfishness is sometimes needed to be the foundation of an independent evil
              will. Thus, he chose to work together with The God of Hell. He did not know that desire to Gods, once
              spawned, there is no way to control it. So The God of Hell accepted his invitation, but departed the
              agreement of mutual benefit. The God of Hell was the first one who along with his magical beast started
              the ranking war.
            </p>
            <p>
              The whole dimension trembled during this strange war. All the living creatures sensed forebodings of
              frightening natural disasters: tsunamis, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes. They prayed, confessed and
              asked the Gods: What had we done wrong? No replies, all that they had were endless catastrophes and
              deaths. The God of Hell underestimated the power generated by the union of the other gods. After many
              defeats, he retreated deep into the inner dimension, there he hid inside the Tree of Life. Tree of Life
              was an amazing tree, planted by the Great One. The entire dimension, resources, the power which the Gods
              possessed came entirely from this tree. It was also the only place which is free from ruling of the six
              Gods. The Tree of Life would not protect any rebels. So The God of Hell had to face the most cruel
              punishment—tortured both physically and spiritually, endlessly bound by chains of ice and fire. Meanwhile,
              those five beasts were sealed individually from one another within five spiritual stones, waiting for time
              to melt them all. None could have thought that these five spiritual stones which were carrying special
              responsibilities, enhanced a stronger power.
            </p>
            <p>
              The power of Gods came from the soul, desire made The Evil God quiet no more, he wanted to steal the
              Spiritual Stones... When he was trying to unseal the Spiritual Stones right in front of the holy table,
              Guarding Prime Gods found him. Another horrible war took place, a war filled with blood and fire, a war
              between evil and justice. The Evil God was defeated and laid down in a pool of his own blood. His blood
              seeped through the Spiritual Stones and he made a felonious curse right before his last breath. No one
              could have thought that the blood of God was the key to unseal the power of the spiritual stones, and the
              stones were to achieve wishes in exchange for life. Thus, the curse came true. As the Gods died one by
              one, becoming spirits, the Sky Passage fell to the middle world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The violent collision had made the civilizations of the middle world fall backward. It pushed the balanced
              living world to the edge of ending, twisting the dimension. These Gods after becoming spirits were merely
              wandering around the outer dimension. They had no body, no power, all that they had were delicate powers
              which merely enabled them to maintain their existence. Everything had returned to the starting point. To
              prevent themselves from falling, the only thing to do was to scramble for the wills and beliefs from those
              creatures in the middle dimension. In spite of that, Gods still presented themselves with noble attitudes.
              Gods helped those races in middle dimension to develop technology, to establish laws, and even teach them
              how to cast spells. In return, all races have to establish a sanctuary to preserve the dignity of Gods as
              well as to acquire more believers. What the Gods needed was to form an army with the believers. In the
              dimensions, nothing could ever escape the universal law of returning. But Gods who adapted the circle
              logic thinking system tempted by the desire to live on, started the biggest war ever—the War of Gods.
              After becoming mad, they no longer had consciousness of the rules of the dimensions... Vengeance, curses
              led to their extermination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wars, cruelties, killings, contests, desire and magic... All these describe this dimension, and provide a
              story with a history filled with surprises, adventures and romances.
